Wasserstein-2 MMD-reguaralized f-divergence particle flows
=========================

This repository provides the method

MMD_reg_f_div_flow (from the file MMD_reg_fDiv_ParticleFlows_CUDA.py)

used to produces the numerical experiments for the paper

Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (Sebastian Neumayer, Viktor Stein, Gabriele Steidl, https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613).

The required packages are

* torch
* scipy
* numpy
* pillow (if you want to generate a gif of the evolution of the flow)
* matplotlib

The other python files contain auxillary functions.

Scripts to exactly reproduce the figures in the preprint are soon to come.
